# Purpose
These scripts are used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between conditions.

# Gene quantification using Salmon

1. Install Salmon and generate Salmon indexed gentrome according to:
https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/

2. Transcript quantification using adaptor trimmed clean reads with salmon.sh. Change the path before running the script.

# Differential gene expression analysis

The analysis is performed in R studio using the pipeline provided.
